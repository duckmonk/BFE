\noindent Dear Immigration Officer: 

\hspace*{2em} On \textbf{RFE-DATE}, USCIS issued the present RFE, requesting the Petitioner to provide additional evidence to establish that the proposed endeavor qualifies as a specific endeavor with national importance, substantial merit, and that \HeSheLow  is well-positioned to advance it, rather than simply engaging in a general occupation. USCIS specified that the Petitioner must demonstrate how her work extends beyond typical responsibilities, showing both a significant impact within her field and the necessary qualifications, support, and commitment to effectively drive the endeavor forward. Furthermore, USCIS noted the requirement to demonstrate exceptional ability. However, the Petitioner has already satisfied the requirements of EB2 classification by holding a Bachelor’s degree and accumulating over five years of progressive work experience in her specialty, as stipulated in 8 CFR 204.5(k)(2). Thus, it is unnecessary for the Petitioner to qualify under the exceptional ability category.

\hspace*{2em} This response and the attached evidence, under the preponderance of evidence standard and taking into consideration of i) the detailed description of Petitioner’s proposed endeavor, ii) evidence supporting the proposed endeavor’s substantial merits and national importance, iii) expert opinion from independent experts in the area of Petitioner’s proposed endeavor, iv) Petitioner’s achievement in proposed endeavor and progress made in proposed endeavor, and v) Petitioner’s detailed future plan to undertake the proposed endeavor, demonstrates that i) Petitioner’s proposed endeavor is specific and has both substantial merit and national importance, ii) Petitioner is well-positioned to advance her proposed endeavors, and iii) on balance, it would be beneficial to the United States to waive the requirements of a job offer and thus of a labor certification.
